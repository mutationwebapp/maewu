Using full names greatly improves mail deliverability, in some cases, dramatically. Crater allows the user to specify a From Mail Name.

When my server sends out invoices, they are frequently marked as spam, because they do not contain a name.</p>\n<p>It also stands to reason that Crater should format To: addresses the same way. Gmail, for example, will almost always mark messages as spam if they are sent to <code>johnsmith@gmail.com</code> instead of <code>John Smith &lt;johnsmith@gmail.com&gt;</code>.
