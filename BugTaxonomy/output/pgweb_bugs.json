Quoting the specification:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A package that has migrated to Go Modules <em>must</em> include the major version in the import path to reference any v2+ modules. For example,  Repo github.com/my/module migrated to Modules on version v3.x.y.  Then this repo should declare its module path with MAJOR version suffix \"/v3\"  (e.g., module <code>github.com/my/module/v3</code>), and its downstream project should use <code>\"github.com/my/module/v3/mypkg\"</code> to import this repo\u2019s package.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This \"github.com/my/module/v3/mypkg\" is not the <code>physical path</code>. So earlier versions of Go (including those that don't have minimal module awareness) plus all tooling (like dep, glide, govendor, etc) don't have <code>minimal module awareness</code> as of now and therefore don't handle import paths correctly See <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/1962\">golang/dep#1962</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/2139\">golang/dep#2139</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: creating a new branch is not required. If instead you have been previously releasing on master and would prefer to tag v3.0.0 on master, that is a viable option. (However, be aware that introducing an incompatible API change in master can cause issues for non-modules users who issue a go get -u given the go tool is not aware of semver prior to Go 1.11 or when module mode is not enabled in Go 1.11+).\nPre-existing dependency management solutions such as dep currently can have problems consuming a v2+ module created in this way. See for example dep#1962.\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#releasing-modules-v2-or-higher</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<h3>1. Migrate to Go Modules.</h3>\n<p>Go Modules is the general trend of ecosystem, if you want a better upgrade package experience, migrating to Go Modules is a good choice.</p>\n<p>Migrate to modules will be accompanied by the introduction of virtual paths(It was discussed above).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This \"github.com/my/module/v3/mypkg\" is not the <code>physical path</code>. So Go versions older than 1.9.7 and 1.10.3 plus all third-party dependency management tools (like dep, glide, govendor, etc) don't have <code>minimal module awareness</code> as of now and therefore don't handle import paths correctly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then the downstream projects might be negatively affected in their building if they are module-unaware (Go versions older than 1.9.7 and 1.10.3; Or use third-party dependency management tools, such as: Dep, glide, govendor\u2026).</p>\n<h3>2. Maintaining v2+ libraries that use Go Modules in Vendor directories.</h3>\n<p>If <code>sosedoff/pgweb</code> want to keep using the dependency manage tools (like dep, glide, govendor, etc), and still want to upgrade the dependencies, can choose this fix strategy.\nManually download the dependencies into the vendor directory and do compatibility dispose(materialize the virtual path or delete the virtual part of the path). Avoid fetching the dependencies by virtual import paths. This may add some maintenance overhead compared to using modules.</p>\n<p>There is 1 module user downstream, such as leogsouza/meower\u2026)\nhttps://github.com/search?q=sosedoff%2Fpgweb+filename%3Ago.mod</p>\n<p>As the import paths have different meanings between the projects adopting module repos and the non-module repos, materialize the virtual path is a better way to solve the issue, while ensuring compatibility with downstream module users. A textbook example provided by repo <code>github.com/moby/moby</code> is here:\nhttps://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/VENDORING.md\nhttps://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/vendor.conf\nIn the vendor directory, <code>github.com/moby/moby</code> adds the <strong>/vN</strong> subdirectory in the corresponding dependencies.\n<strong>This will help more downstream module users to work well with your package.</strong></p>\n<h3>3. Request upstream to do compatibility processing.</h3>\n<p>The <code>gin-gonic/gin</code> have 2110 module-unaware users in github, such as: yogaagungk/assets-management, aduermael/dockerblog, gdevillele/calvados\u2026\nhttps://github.com/search?q=gin-gonic%2Fgin+filename%3Avendor.conf+filename%3Avendor.json+filename%3Aglide.toml+filename%3AGodep.toml+filename%3AGodep.json&amp;type=Code</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>You can make a choice when you meet this DM issues by balancing your own development schedules/mode against the affects on the downstream projects.</p>\n<p>For this issue, Solution 1 can maximize your benefits and with minimal impacts to your downstream projects the ecosystem. </p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#semantic-import-versioning</li>\n<li>https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_compatibility_and_semantic_versioning</li>\n<li>https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#releasing-modules-v2-or-higher</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do you plan to upgrade the libraries in near future?\nHope this issue report can help you ^_^\nThank you very much for your attention.</p>\n<p>Best regards,\nKate</p>", ["<p>@sosedoff  @jc00ke  Could you help me review this issue?

If you like, I can add the commit with that to this PR, or as a separate PR. But I was unable to change psql's (client side) messages language, so \nfinally I had to change my Linux's locale. </p>\n<p>So I'll try to fix the rest of your notes. What goes to cleaning the table, I still suggest not to do that. Just write in the import that we are adding records, instead of calling it \"import\". But if you confirm your decision, I'll implement it. </p>", "<p>Haha, I found this one: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/\uff19.6/sql-copy.html\nIt allows to feed data via stdin and can read csv format. So it looks like we should not parse csv ourselves, but instead delegate the file contents to the psql via stdin... \nI'll experiment with it. </p>", "<p>So something simple as \n<code>/y/go/src/github.com/sosedoff/pgweb$ cat /y/a.csv | psql -c \"\\\\copy zzz (text,id) from stdin with (format csv, header true)\"</code> does the job. \\copy command is advertized to be a counterpart of copy which one can run from psql if having no permissions to call copy. Also one can use just copy, w/o backslashes - it works either. </p>\n<p>So one way to go is to simply run psql from stdin. We check that fields match, generate field order so that csv and postgres table match, direct file contents to stdin of psql and spawn psql from pgweb. We can fail however under stupid platforms like ms windows where stdin can be broken sometimes (e.g. fail to support utf-8), or if there are some bugs/limitations related to spawning. So furhter experiments are required. Can you please give a feedback about this approach? </p>", "<p>Fixed all the issues that I was able to understand and which I believe are really issues. The only thing that is missing is tests. </p>", "<p>I posted a few more notes. As for <code>COPY</code> with <code>psql</code> - im okay with that approach as long as it works with SSH tunnel (see database dump feature)</p>", "<p>Seem to fix everything. Also added refreshing of table lists and some simple input data validation. Most questionalbe is the change in css files - I removed a fixed alignment for output pane. All seem to be ok at a glance, maybe I overlooked something. Without that change import button didn't work. \nDidn't add the test for the entire import. I didn't find an essential api tests so there is no infrastructure, and so far I'm not smart enough to generate one quickly. Any hints? What goes to COPY, I decided not to go into it now - it is just another project. </p>", "<p>Added an integration test. Maybe it is horrible due to lack of understaning of pgweb's globals, but I made it work finally :) </p>", "<p>I dislike this way of testing, but I don't know how to do it better. What is actually done here is a fork of main module. After the fork, application was initialized so that testing scenario has access to both web API (can send requests and get the response), and to the database directly. When testing web api, session stuff is kind of faked, so that there is no login / call api/ logout sequence. IMO this is messy. What I really want to do here is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create and import the DB</li>\n<li>run pgweb as an application from the script (with Exec.Command and pipes)</li>\n<li>login into it</li>\n<li>call /import/csv api to import data</li>\n<li>call /query api </li>\n<li>logout</li>\n<li>drop db</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This way it is a sort of API testing. \nHowever, there are questions. I don't see how to do that with an embedded testing framework, because I need to build pgweb before running the test. </p>\n<p>There are options:</p>\n<p>i) make the thin layer between main() and app functionality, like <code>func main() { return Main() }</code>. For testing purposes, run Main in a goroutine, and also run a test script in a main thread. Test script only communicates with Main via HTTP and when done sends termination signal. </p>\n<p>ii) use Docker. I think that's an overkill</p>\n<p>iii) write a separated golang application and use a makefile to run it (we will be unable to use <code>go test</code>)</p>\n<p>Your ideas? </p>", "<p>Yeah, tests are kind of tricky due to the way how pgweb is written (this'll change with 1.0 version). \nI'd be interested in a test in <code>client_test.go</code> that handles the actual CSV import, don't bother too much with testing the API endpoint. If you're not sure how to proceed - do the full squash of all your changes and i can add the tests. </p>", "<p>Actually I'm in progress to test it via API endpoint and it seems that I'm not very far from obtaining a prettier test. I personally prefer integration tests because they give more value per line of test code :) I hope to finish that today and maybe will do another squashed PR. </p>", "<p>Well, now I'm satisfied with the result.

Since i don't use Heroku i can't comment on that, but here are my thoughts on the AWS bits:\n* You currently require passing access_key and secret_key for AWS authentication. That is quite limiting in a lot of situations. I'd suggest that instead of failing if either one of those is not passed via CLI or ENV to fall back on the default credential chain in the AWS SDK. It takes into account several ENV variables, the aws-cli config files (~/.aws/config and ~/.aws/credentials) as well as EC2 instance profiles and ECS container profiles if you deploy inside your AWS account. It can deal with assumed roles and the required additional tokens (AWS auth can be quite complex ...). It would be kinda like you already read the HEROKU_TOKEN from .netrc.\n* It'd be cool if in addition to the plain postgres instances the discovery would also list the aurora-postgres clusters (see my original PR) ideally, although not strictly required, with the ability to connect to the read-only endpoint if pgweb is running in read-only mode.\n* As a long term goal, definitely out of scope for the basic discovery feature, it'd be cool to support IAM authentication towards the database although tbh i have no practical experience with that yet.</p>\n<p>Anyway, really excited about this feature and can't wait to see where it goes.

For the AWS config files i'd really recommend against parsing them yourself. I'd say if the access_key and secret_key aren't passed via CLI flags just hand of the credential acquisition to the SDK.

Check out the wiki page here: https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb/wiki/Connect-Backend. You can build a web page that will fetch all available databases from RDS and then list them on the page where users can simply click and connect to the database. When user opens up the special link, Pgweb will make a HTTP request to your website with the resource identifier and will expect the connection details in the response. Then it'll try to connect to the specified database and make a new session, everything else will work the same from there. I'm not sure if you tried that solution.

Since the contents of the column can be arbitrarily large in my application I am using Clob functionality.  I investigated the source code to see  how the driver is implemented.  When using Clobs the steps it takes are basically the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Invoke the LargeObjectManager as described at <a href=\"https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/94/binary-data.html\">Chapter 7. Storing Binary Data</a> and create a handle (oid) to a large object entry in <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/catalog-pg-largeobject.html\">pg_largeobject</a> and <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/catalog-pg-largeobject-metadata.html\">pg_largeobject_metadata</a></li>\n<li>Write the bytes to pg_largeobject using the handle</li>\n<li>Write the handle oid value to the column of the target table</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This explains why you saw numerical incrementing values in the payload column.  They were oid references to pg_largeobject.</p>\n<p>I am not sure what a good solution would look like here since a text column can also hold normal strings.  How would one differentiate between an oid reference and a string?  Perhaps provide a way to manually tell pgweb \"this value should be dereferenced in pg_largeobject+pg_largeobject_metadata\"? </p>", "<p>@rex-sheridan i'm not sure what to do about this issue. i've never used largeobjects feature before.

That way we can have a connection token on the client (browser) that will correspond to a server connection. There's already something like that in place: session connections. When sessions are enabled (<code>--sessions</code> flag) you can have multiple connections, one per browser tab (using session storage). This approach will still require user to specify the connection credentials or choose a bookmark. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can have a bookmarks file in your system that will provide access to all your connections. You might as well manage that file dynamically (once you allocate/deallocate resources). Each bookmark must have a unique filename (*.toml). Pros: we don't expose any server credentials in the url and just use the bookmark name as a reference. Cons: each client that has access to the exposed pgweb instance will be able to use any of the available bookmarks without any restrictions. Perhaps we can add a new attribute to the bookmarks file that will clearly indicate that the bookmark file is not \"discoverable\", meaning it won't be listed anywhere in the pgweb. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are a couple featured that aim at making the pgweb be used in \"exporer\" mode (<code>--readonly</code>, <code>--lock-session</code> flags). However, they're not 100% bulletproof as they're not enforcing any particular rules on the database. Try those, maybe they're good enough for your use case. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With all that said, my only concern is that not enough people expressed their interest in the functionality in question. I'm interested to work on this since i have the same issue once in a while, but i'd like implement it in a most generic way and keep things simple.</p>\n<p>Let me know anyway.

If a pull request is an option I'd be happy to make the necessary changes to fit with pgweb's code in a cleaner manner.</p>\n<p>My high-level design:\nThe integrating website has a page with a HTML <code>&lt;iframe /&gt;</code> pointing to <code>https://pgweb-domain/authorize/&lt;requested db id&gt;</code>.\nAccessing this domain would:\n1. <strong>seamlessly</strong> authenticate the user against the identity provider (<code>SSO</code> - <code>OIDC</code>) using my <code>gin_oidc</code> middleware\n2. authorize the access - make sure the user should have access to the requested DB\n3. get the DB's connection URL\n4. connect the user to the DB\n5. send redirect response to pgweb's homepage (he'll skip the connection form since he's connected)\n6. if there was an error in the process - redirect to an error page</p>\n<p><strong>note on (2) + (3):</strong> (<code>\"getConnUrlEndpoint\"</code>) developers should add a <code>POST</code> endpoint (possibly with <code>CORS</code> and <code>OPTIONS</code> enabled - depends on the architecture) to their website's backend that will receive  user's info (<code>oidc claims</code> acquired during authentication) and the <code>&lt;requested db id&gt;</code> and upon successful authorization will return the DB connection URL. Upon failure an error will be returned. My current implementation requests a <code>bearer access token</code> from the Identity provider configured in <code>\"credentialsOidcConfig\"</code> in the json configurations file, and sends it in the authorization HTTP header. I guess it's an overkill if the endpoint is on the same server and limited only to <code>localhost</code> but that's not the case in my architecture, plus we're passing credentials so I prefer a safer implementation. I guess this could be optional.</p>\n<p><strong>node on (6):</strong> (<code>errorEndpoint</code> ) developers should add a <code>GET</code> endpoint to their website's backend that will receive an error message in the query parameter <code>err</code> and show an error page (or do whatever they want)</p>\n<p>configurations file example(<code>secrets.json</code> in executable's dir):</p>\n<p><code>``javascript\n{\n  //(string) id in the authorization service (OIDC provider)\n  clientId,\n  //(string) secret from the authorization service (OIDC provider)\n  clientSecret, \n  //(string) the URL identifier for the authorization service. for example: \"https://accounts.google.com\" - try adding \"/.well-known/openid-configuration\" to the end of the path to make sure it's correct\n  issuer, \n  //(string) pgweb's url. for example: \"http://localhost:8081/\" or \"https://pgweb.mydomain.com/ - we can also extract it from pgweb's</code>--bind<code>flag\n  pgwebUrl,\n  //(array of strings) OAuth scopes. for example: [\"openid\", \"profile\", \"email\"]\n  scopes, \n  //redirection url after logout\n  LogoutRedirectUrl,\n}\n{\n  //users authentication OIDC configurations\n  \"usersOidcConfig\": {\n    //(string) id in the authorization service (OIDC provider)\n    \"clientId\": \"pgweb\",\n    //(string) secret from the authorization service (OIDC provider)\n    \"clientSecret\": \"cd850d22-791e-4347-9220-fb6da8f8271d\",\n    //(string) the URL identifier for the authorization service. for example: \"https://accounts.google.com\" - try adding \"/.well-known/openid-configuration\" to the end of the path to make sure it's correct\n    \"issuer\": \"http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/Developers\",\n    //(array of strings) OAuth scopes. for example: [\"openid\", \"profile\", \"email\"]\n    \"scopes\": [\n      \"openid\",\n      \"profile\",\n      \"email\"\n    ]\n  },\n  //pgweb's bearer OIDC configurations (might be the same as 'usersOidcConfig')\n  \"credentialsOidcConfig\": {\n    \"clientId\": \"pgweb\",\n    \"clientSecret\": \"cd850d22-791e-4347-9220-fb6da8f8271d\",\n    \"issuer\": \"http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/Developers\",\n    \"scopes\": [\n      \"openid\",\n      \"profile\",\n      \"email\"\n    ]\n  },\n  //(string) pgweb's url. for example: \"http://localhost:8081/\" or \"https://pgweb.mydomain.com/ - we can also extract it from pgweb's</code>--bind` flag\n  \"pgwebUrl\": \"http://localhost:8081/\",\n  //(string) redirection url after logout\n  \"logoutRedirectUrl\": \"http://localhost:3000/\",\n  //(string) the endpoint developers should implement for the authorization and retrival of connection credentials\n  \"getConnUrlEndpoint\": \"http://localhost:3000/pgweb/get-conn-url\",\n  //(string) the endpoint developers should implement to handle with errors\n  \"errorEndpoint\": \"http://localhost:3000/pgweb/error\"\n}</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>to run pgweb use:</p>\n<p><code>bash\n./pgweb --server-sessions --sessions --skip-open</code></p>\n<p>Here's an implementation of <code>getConnUrlEndpoint</code> and <code>errorEndpoint</code> in an express app:\n(NOTE - access token validation is not included.

Here's how it would work in combination with oauth2-proxy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Start the proxy with all the config flags and settings you need, add the <code>-upstream</code> flag to point to the pgweb</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the pgweb server with backend flags:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>pgweb \\\n  --sessions \\\n  --connect-backend=http://your-internal-url/ \\\n  --connect-token=test \\\n  --connect-headers=X-Forwarded-Email,X-Forwarded-User,X-Forwarded-Access-Token</code></p>\n<p>We will still need the <code>--connect-token</code> in order to make sure that all the \nrequests originating from pgweb are verified by a third-party connect backend\napi. </p>\n<p>The next part is <code>--connect-headers</code>. Any listed headers names will be grabbed\nand passed through to the connect backend api. In this particular case, oauth2-proxy\nwill inject those headers automatically, except for <code>X-Forwarded-Access-Token</code>. \nYou'll have to start oauth2-proxy with <code>-pass-access-token</code> flag.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Connect phase</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When user visits http://yourhost/connect/ID, first it hits the oauth2-proxy that\nwill validate credentials (google/github/whatever), then it will make a call to \npgweb on <code>/connect/ID</code> path. Pgweb on its part will build a JSON payload (see below)\nand make a call to the connect backend. If backend responds with a valid \n<code>database_url</code> key (response must be json-encoded) then pgweb will try to connect\nto the provided resource url.</p>\n<p>Example JSON payload pgweb will send to the connect api:</p>\n<p><code>json\n{\n  \"resource\": \"testresource\",\n  \"token\": \"backendtoken\",\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"x-forwarded-access-token\": \"ya29.GlvNBAv52OrEW7Wx-tF9ntL442...redacted\",\n    \"x-forwarded-email\": \"dan.sosedoff@gmail.com\",\n    \"x-forwarded-user\": \"dan.sosedoff\"\n  }\n}</code></p>\n<p>As far as i can see this strategy covers pretty much all the ends while keeping\npgweb slim and simple.  </p>\n<p>Let me know if that works for you or if you have any other thoughts.</p>", "<p>@sosedoff Looks great. I can work with that.\nThanks!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>One other note. It might be off-topic. I can open another issue if you'd like. It's regarding pgweb's <code>\"x-session-id\"</code> http header.</p>\n<p>Lets say <code>user A</code> and <code>user B</code> both sign in and access their DBs. If <code>user B</code> somehow gets a hold on <code>user A</code>'s <code>sessionId</code> he can go to <code>http://mypgweb.domain/?session=&lt;user A's session id&gt;</code> and access a DB he shouldn't be able to access. It's pretty hard to get a hold on the <code>sessionId</code> value, since http request header &amp; query parameters are end-to-end encrypted with <code>https</code>. Still there are security issues I don't want to get into. </p>\n<p>The bottom line is - it might be a good idea to integrate a more advanced approach internally (it won't affect pgweb's API).

I believe that all that would be required would be make all client side code &amp; assets reference <em>root</em> as <code>./</code> instead of <code>/</code>.</p>\n<p>The serverside (API) code should work just fine without change, since the proxy will strip the <code>/db</code> from the beginning of each request.</p>\n<p>If this a patch that you'd accept if I were to write it?</p>", ["<p>Sure, if you have a patch that does not introduce any breaking changes i'd gladly accept it.</p>", "<p>On the other hand i would probably prefer a solution that changes the path prefix for the whole application. That would work better IMO. Thoughts?</p>", "<p>In short: I don't think it adds any additional value.  To elaborate...</p>\n<p>I think the value of relative paths is being able to run pgweb alongside another web app (so pgweb doesn't need an entire subdomain).  However, to do that, you're going to need an HTTP reverse proxy in front of it anyway (since how else would you share the same tcp port)?</p>\n<p>I could see 3 possible scenarios here to run Pgweb next to another web app.</p>\n<p>```\n1.\nINTERNET ----&gt; NGINX ---  /db/* ---- &gt; PGWEB\n                 --- * ---&gt; OTHER WEB APP</p>\n<p>2.\nINTERNET ----&gt; OTHER WEB APP ---  /db/* ---- &gt; PGWEB\n                     ---- * ---&gt; OTHER WEB APP</p>\n<p>3.\nINTERNET ----&gt; PGWEB ---  /db/* ---- &gt; PGWEB\n                   ---- * ---&gt; OTHER WEB APP</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>For solutions 1 and 2, I think there is absolutely no value in adding a prefix in Go, since every single reverse proxy basically provides this out of the box.  (This is <em>so</em> common, in fact, I think it might be a lot of extra work to leave the prefix on).</p>\n<p>For solution 3, I suppose it would be useful - but I don't know if I would recommend proxying all your web traffic through pgweb :)</p>", "<p>I don't necessarily agree that having a url prefix does not provide any value. Having a url prefix baked into the app's makes it super easy to use with software like nginx.</p>\n<p>I pushed a new git branch <code>url-prefix</code> that implements url prefix for pgweb, you can compile the source code from that branch and then start pgweb with <code>--prefix=db/</code>. </p>\n<p>For nginx, then you can configure pgweb as follows:</p>\n<p>```\nupstream pgweb {\n  server 127.0.0.1:8081;\n}</p>\n<p>server {\n  # other stuff\n  # ...</p>\n<p># proxy any database stuff directly to pgweb\n  location /db {\n    proxy_pass http://pgweb;\n  } \n}\n```</p>\n<p>If that works for you - great, otherwise please provide your own solution and will gladly review and accept the patch for the feature in question.

I see frameworks, libraries, operating systems, etc, as tools. You wouldn't fasten a nail with a screwdriver, right? This happens in developers everyday lives as well.

Ember isn't <strong>at all</strong> stuck in the past. There is a difference between <strong>stability</strong> and <strong>stagnation</strong> that people don't seem to understand. Ember is stable, but not stalled. Ember's motivation is <em>Stability without Stagnation</em> (credits to @tomdale on this one :D).\nConsider reading the brand new <a href=\"https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/15\">Ember 2.0 plan</a> and see the differences for yourself.
