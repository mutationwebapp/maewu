It's not trivial to wrap one's head around the depth of the complexity in this code, and I've spent a lot of time doing so, but I feel like I may be missing something at this point.</p>\n<p>In addition to the obvious client&lt;--&gt;backend flow whether over RPC or PubSub via WAMP, a use case that I was thinking of that would come in very handy for my own adaptation/extension of this is a more nuanced service to service communication. To be clear, as architected here, it is easy for, say, the trading execution service to listen a known-ahead-of-time topic \"prices\" on the broker, so that it is essentially capturing ALL of the price data that flows from the pricing service (if available, or basically just nothing if no pricing service instance is running)</p>\n<p>However, modifying this so that the trade execution service could connect to a specific traded currency price stream using the RPC (to get topic name) then pubsub method to the least 'loaded' pricing instance seems less tractable using the current code base. Certainly on the javascript client side there is a lot of work that has been poured into this - the bulk of the magic which seems to be in the serviceClient and serviceBase and other supporting classes wherein a status stream is listened to to learn the name of the pricing service, then requests are made to that specific instance. However, has any of this logic been implemented on the backend (.net) side? Perhaps I am just missing something (as I have been known to do)...but just to be clear, the basic idea is that I want a trade execution instance on the backend to be able to find the 'best' pricing instance to use and then send a request to listen to the price feed for a specific traded currency, and not just \"all\" prices, since clearly in the real world there are market data pricing issues and so forth and I can't just subscribe to \"everything\"</p>\n<p>If I were to try and recreate the above sort of functionality on the .net side any advice ahead of time would be appreciated - certainly starting with the javascript class and porting to .net I imagine would work eventually but seems like it could end up being a non-trivial amount of work and so I wanted to pose this question here first! and thanks again!</p>", []]}, {"subject": "reactive", "link": "/AdaptiveConsulting/ReactiveTraderCloud/issues/707", "title": "[Chrome] Grid Filter Issues", "status": "closed", "labels": ["bug", "frontend"], "priority": null, "description": ["<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Filter scroll on Dropdown list check box is showing above the border line \n<img alt=\"filterscrollddl-reactive trader cloud\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24304223/37426386-a4c6551e-279c-11e8-9613-b9cdbc5a90c2.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Date filter is missing the month abbreviation \n<img alt=\"datefiltercalendar-reactive trader cloud\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24304223/37426416-bc2b35bc-279c-11e8-8d49-34e182c512d0.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n</ol>", ["<p>This has been tested against the latest release and the reported issued does not seem to be resolved across all the filters available in the blotter.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>"]]}, {"subject": "reactive", "link": "/AdaptiveConsulting/ReactiveTraderCloud/issues/706", "title": "[IE] Grid Filter Issues ", "status": "closed", "labels": ["bug", "frontend"], "priority": null, "description": ["<ol>\n<li>\n<p>When focus is on the free text filter - there are 2 close icons overlapping (attach1)\n<img alt=\"filter focus - reactive trader cloud - internet explorer\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24304223/37422223-2332d64a-2791-11e8-9578-7b71a11bac48.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Column filters have 2 arrows for the drop-down selectio(attach2) \n<img alt=\"dds - reactive trader cloud - internet explorer\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24304223/37422495-9cf38b46-2791-11e8-98cc-9b2ef68d760f.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[IE and Edge] ]Date Filter is missing a calendar selection option and basically does not work(attach3) \n<img alt=\"calendar - internet explorer\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24304223/37422609-ed8b22b2-2791-11e8-8f82-25c6386216aa.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>Rate filter EQUALS does not work \n<img alt=\"rate-reactive trader cloud - internet explorer\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24304223/37422828-8becad72-2792-11e8-82f4-86a3feff3e08.png\" /></li>\n</ol>", ["<p>This has been tested against the latest release and the reported issued does not seem to be resolved across all the filters available in the blotter.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>"]]}, {"subject": "reactive", "link": "/AdaptiveConsulting/ReactiveTraderCloud/issues/697", "title": "Spot date from pricing service is incorrect", "status": "closed", "labels": ["backend"], "priority": null, "description": ["<p>Incorrect spot date on spot tile is a server side issue: class MeanReversionRandomWalkPriceGenerator calculates the spot date as T+2 including weekends.

To be clear, as architected here, it is easy for, say, the trading execution service to listen a known-ahead-of-time topic \"prices\" on the broker, so that it is essentially capturing ALL of the price data that flows from the pricing service (if available, or basically just nothing if no pricing service instance is running)</p>\n<p>However, modifying this so that the trade execution service could connect to a specific traded currency price stream using the RPC (to get topic name) then pubsub method to the least 'loaded' pricing instance seems less tractable using the current code base. Certainly on the javascript client side there is a lot of work that has been poured into this - the bulk of the magic which seems to be in the serviceClient and serviceBase and other supporting classes wherein a status stream is listened to to learn the name of the pricing service, then requests are made to that specific instance. However, has any of this logic been implemented on the backend (.net) side? Perhaps I am just missing something (as I have been known to do)...but just to be clear, the basic idea is that I want a trade execution instance on the backend to be able to find the 'best' pricing instance to use and then send a request to listen to the price feed for a specific traded currency, and not just \"all\" prices, since clearly in the real world there are market data pricing issues and so forth and I can't just subscribe to \"everything\"</p>\n<p>If I were to try and recreate the above sort of functionality on the .net side any advice ahead of time would be appreciated - certainly starting with the javascript class and porting to .net I imagine would work eventually but seems like it could end up being a non-trivial amount of work and so I wanted to pose this question here first! and thanks again!</p>", []]}, {"subject": "reactive", "link": "/AdaptiveConsulting/ReactiveTraderCloud/issues/707", "title": "[Chrome] Grid Filter Issues", "status": "closed", "labels": ["bug", "frontend"], "priority": null, "description": ["<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Filter scroll on Dropdown list check box is showing above the border line \n<img alt=\"filterscrollddl-reactive trader cloud\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24304223/37426386-a4c6551e-279c-11e8-9613-b9cdbc5a90c2.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Date filter is missing the month abbreviation \n<img alt=\"datefiltercalendar-reactive trader cloud\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24304223/37426416-bc2b35bc-279c-11e8-8d49-34e182c512d0.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n</ol>", ["<p>This has been tested against the latest release and the reported issued does not seem to be resolved across all the filters available in the blotter.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>"]]}, {"subject": "reactive", "link": "/AdaptiveConsulting/ReactiveTraderCloud/issues/706", "title": "[IE] Grid Filter Issues ", "status": "closed", "labels": ["bug", "frontend"], "priority": null, "description": ["<ol>\n<li>\n<p>When focus is on the free text filter - there are 2 close icons overlapping (attach1)\n<img alt=\"filter focus - reactive trader cloud - internet explorer\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24304223/37422223-2332d64a-2791-11e8-9578-7b71a11bac48.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Column filters have 2 arrows for the drop-down selectio(attach2) \n<img alt=\"dds - reactive trader cloud - internet explorer\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24304223/37422495-9cf38b46-2791-11e8-98cc-9b2ef68d760f.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[IE and Edge] ]Date Filter is missing a calendar selection option and basically does not work(attach3) \n<img alt=\"calendar - internet explorer\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24304223/37422609-ed8b22b2-2791-11e8-8f82-25c6386216aa.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>Rate filter EQUALS does not work \n<img alt=\"rate-reactive trader cloud - internet explorer\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24304223/37422828-8becad72-2792-11e8-82f4-86a3feff3e08.png\" /></li>\n</ol>", ["<p>This has been tested against the latest release and the reported issued does not seem to be resolved across all the filters available in the blotter.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>"]]}, {"subject": "reactive", "link": "/AdaptiveConsulting/ReactiveTraderCloud/issues/697", "title": "Spot date from pricing service is incorrect", "status": "closed", "labels": ["backend"], "priority": null, "description": ["<p>Incorrect spot date on spot tile is a server side issue: class MeanReversionRandomWalkPriceGenerator calculates the spot date as T+2 including weekends.

I'm so curious why you choose for WAMP &amp; Crossbar instead of other messaging platforms, like SignalR and RabbitMQ for example. Saw the wiki entry on this topic, but unfortunately it is only a placeholder. Could you enlighten us :) ?</p>", ["<p>Hey promontis, </p>\n<p>We used SignalR for messaging in the previous incarnation of Reactive Trader with clients communicating with a single service and it worked well.</p>\n<p>For this project, we were working with a number of services and were looking to minimize the number of connections a client had to make so decide to use a broker. This ruled out SignalR. \nAs far as broker choices go, Crossbar.IO isn't as fully-featured as RabbitMQ but it does everything we need (RPC &amp; pub-sub) and runs out of the box over websocket with long-polling fallback, like SignalR but with a broker.</p>\n<p>Looking back, as we only need to connect to 5 or 6 services, I think it'd actually be fine to connect to them directly using SignalR. We could introduce some kind of discovery service that clients could use to find out which services are available (we could have more than one of these) which would allows us to remove the broker as a single point of failure.</p>\n<p>Hope this sheds a little bit of light.\nJames</p>", "<p>There's a blog post in the works on this - I'll leave this issue open until we publish that post.</p>", "<p>Thnx for the explanation @JPWatson! Really helpful! </p>\n<p>Looking back, would you still build everything using crossbar? Or would you use SignalR?</p>\n<p>I've also did some searching on the internet... http://tavendo.com/blog/post/is-crossbar-the-future-of-python-web-apps/ is a good post on this subject. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WAMP compares to AMQP, and e.g. Crossbar.io compares to RabbitMQ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Still looking into why WAMP instead of AMQP. I think AMQP is a bit more popular on the web, but I don't mind using a less popular tech if it is better suited. </p>\n<p>Could you guys - having actually used crossbar - give something like a comparison between the two? When would you use crossbar vs the likes of signalr + rabbitmq? Or perhaps WAMP vs AMQP? </p>\n<p>Also, did you look into stateful services? It seems a real-time trading system would be really suited. For example, Akka.NET or Azure Service Fabric.</p>", "<p>If we didn't use a broker, I think SignalR would do the job perfectly well. </p>\n<p>AMQP has definitely been around longer. It has a lot more flexibility that we just didn't need for this project and with flexibility comes extra complexity so we went with the simpler option. \nFor example, one of the differences is that WAMP has request response out of the box whereas you need to build it yourself with AMQP using correlation ids or some similar mechanism.</p>\n<p>We did look briefly at Akka.NET but didn't have time in the end to fully explore it, it's quite a paradigm shift.
